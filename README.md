# Experience-Nepal
Website made for Hackthon at IT Meet v8.0 organized by Kathmandu University

## Idea
A website to help improve the Tourism Industry of Nepal along with helping for the grand success of Visit Nepal 2020 project. Made this website while participating different competitions. There is still a lot of improvement to do in this website along with making an app.

This website also focuses on highlighting different under-rated places of Nepal using **Reedem Code**. The idea is to let users collect **Reedem Code** by visiting diffferent places around the country. The collected codes can be spent at diiferent shops. We decided to have high **Reedem Code** in underrated places to attract more attentation to that place. If the number of tourist visiting certain place depends on the season or other criteria that changes time to time then we decrease the **Reedem Code** points earned at that place when the tourist number is high and increase as the tourist number decreases. Our website also tries to promote using national agencies over international agencies while visiting Nepal which could help develop the tourism industry of Nepal.

**Important:** The **Reedem Code** and **Ratings** give to the places are completly random and dosent reflect its true beauty.
